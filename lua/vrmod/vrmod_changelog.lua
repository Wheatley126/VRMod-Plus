-fixed root cause behind at least 3 different lua errors that could happen randomly in multiplayer
-fixed some error spam related to pac3
-fixed 2 errors related to disconnecting while in vr
-pac outfits are now automatically rendered in both eyes when in vr

Version 115:
-adds support for (and requires) module version 20. The changes to the module are:
-GetPoses/GetActions now re-use most tables instead of creating new ones every time.
This should be better for performance and also allows creating direct references to poses
in lua without having to access them through multiple tables every time.
-Removed string comparisons from GetPoses/GetActions as a micro optimization.
-GetActions now additionally returns a table of changed boolean actions. This is to avoid
having to loop thru every action on the lua side to manually check for changes and makes
checking for presses/releases easier in general.
-GetDisplayInfo now takes nearz/farz values as arguments instead of using hardcoded values

Version 114:
-adds support for (and requires) module version 19. This version moves rendering related calculations from the module to the addon. This makes it possible to do rendering experiments and things like native offset projection and support for canted displays without reprojection in the future without requiring additional module updates. Also added error code display to vr_init errors

Version 113:
-fixed floating hands randomly not working

Version 112:
-added option to enable engine postprocessing (such as bloom or color correction built into maps)
-fixed bug that would break the game if you died while hovering over a weapon icon with the VR weapon menu open
-fixed vr menu system cursor focusing on the wrong layer when there are overlapping menus (such as settings window in front of height adjustment window)
-added haptics to grip binds for default index controller binds and reduced grip force threshold by 20%. There used to be a bug in SteamVR where haptics would always be triggered on the index controllers at a certain grip force even if it was disabled in the binds or when the grips weren't used at all. The old default binds were designed around this bug by matching the force threshold in the binds to this unwanted haptic feedback. It seems like this was fixed in some SteamVR update which left index users with no haptic feedback for the default vrmod grip binds.
-fixed bug where viewmodel muzzle position would get warped based on head angle for some users depending on their gmod settings (noticeable with the weapon laserpointer option enabled). Also fixed a similiar bug where this would always happen with the toolgun.

Version 111:
-fixed errors in multiplayer introduced by 110

Version 110:
-added support for worldtips (such as those that appear when aiming at thrusters)
-added support for halos, this fixes issues such as the view going blurry with the physgun pickup halo, or other halos only rendering in one eye

-players arms no longer get messed up when the player is tilted too much in a chair

-player is now fullbright in height mirror

Version 108:
-potentially fixed error messages not displaying in vrmod menu for some people
-fixed lua error when enabling climbing system in unsupported maps
-updated module version display to the actual latest version
-added detection for error case where module is installed but not initializing
-removed vrmod_update concommand (which was used to display module update script location) as a recent gmod update removed the function it relied on

Version 107:
-added wip climbing system, which is currently limited to ladders in HL2 maps in single player
-vr flashlight is now affected by r_flashlightfar and r_flashlightfov convars
-added vrmod_version convar which should be visible in server queries, making it easier to search for vrmod enabled servers

Version 106:
-fixed pickup system bug which could result in being unable to spawn ammo while using arcvr guns

Version 105:
-fixed menu clicks registering multiple times on some controller bindings, most commonly causing vive users to not be able to press the chat keyboard button

Version 104:
-picking up a prop no longer resets some of its physical properties (for example gravity and welds), this also fixes a bug where plugging in the teleporter in kleiners lab would crash the game sometimes
-added convar for adjusting crouch height threshold: vrmod_crouchthreshold

Version 103:
-a new module version is available which fixes the "CreateDevice failed" error and some others

Version 102:
-added noclip to quickmenu

Version 101:
-added improved teleport locomotion inspired by steamvr home. it can be accessed using the previously unused "chat" controller bind
-removed old teleport tool

Version 100:
-removed vr hands from player models
-replaced "hide player model" option with "use floating hands". This is also usable in multiplayer unlike the previous single-player only playermodel, as this keeps your original player model.

-fixed glitched looking hand when using weapons that don't have a hand pose (caused by a previous update)
-added some lua api functions:
vrmod.GetTrackedDeviceNames() (requires module update)
vrmod.GetLeftEyePos()
vrmod.GetRightEyePos()

-improved camera transition when entering/exiting vehicles
-hdr no longer affects menus to improve visibility
-fixed teleport tool lua error caused by a previous update
-fixed misaligned hands sometimes in vehicles caused by a previous update
-fixed player disappearing while waiting for tracking in multiplayer caused by a previous update

-renamed hooks to not use the old VRUtil* naming scheme. A backwards compatibility system is temporarily in place so most compatible addons should still work

-added hook "VRMod_OpenQuickMenu"
-adding a quickmenu item with existing name overwrites instead of adding a new one

-added "Reset settings to default" button to vrmod menu
-added Lua API function vrmod.AddInGameMenuItem( name, slot, slotpos, func, reopenfunc )

-added following functions to Lua API:
vrmod.AddLocomotionOption( name, startFunc, stopFunc, buildCPanelFunc )
vrmod.StartLocomotion()
vrmod.StopLocomotion()
